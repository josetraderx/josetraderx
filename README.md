I started my career in quantitative trading, where I learned how unreliable data can lead to expensive mistakes. That experience drives how I work as a Data Engineer today: I build robust, real-time data systems that turn noisy inputs into clean, actionable outputs.

My focus is on scalable ETL pipelines, automation, and cloud-ready architectures using Python, SQL, Spark, dbt, AWS, FastAPI, Snowflake, and TimescaleDB.

From SEC filings to fraud detection, I build data solutions teams can trust — under pressure, and at scale.
